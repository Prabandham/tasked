User -> Project -> User


A user Has and belongs to many Projects (Project is just a namespace)

Which he can share with other Users (Using their email-id)

If a project (namespace) has only the user. Then it will have just a list of tasks.


Project has many phases. (default_phase) for a single User and a Project.

If There are more than one user in the Project then it automatically will shift to a trello kind of UI
with websockets enabled.

Project -> (HasMany) -> Phases -> (HasMany) -> Tasks

Task
  UserID the user to which this task is assigned to (defaults to the one adding the task).
  PhaseId the phase to which this task belongs to.
  Description A short description what the task is.
  DueDate DateTime before which this task has to be completed
  CreatedAt
  DeletedAt
  CompletedAt //This is used only when things are in default_state



Phase
  name (default_phase) if only one User in the Project.

# Scenario:

## Project with Only One User.

By default this project will have one Phase called (default_phase)

And to this the User can add as many Tasks as he wants.


-------------------------
Create Task              |
-------------------------

1. Task One   ()
2. Task Two   ()
3. Task Three ()


In Case of multiple Users per Project then it will look like trello
